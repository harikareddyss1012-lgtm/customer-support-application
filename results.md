## 4. Cited Answers (3 answerable questions)

> Run via `POST /api/chat` with `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` and paste responses here.

### Cited Answer 1

**Question**: What does ERR-4032 mean and what is the fix?

**Answer**:
ERR-4032 means: "Subscription plan not found in UBP catalogue — legacy custom plan has no UBP equivalent."

To fix it, support must recreate the missing custom plan in UBP Admin → Plans → Create Custom, then migrate the subscription to the new UBP plan via Admin → Subscriptions → Migrate.

**chunk_id cited**: `BM-006::t1`

### Cited Answer 2

**Question**: What steps fix ERR-4031 after SSO mapping breaks?

**Answer**:
ERR-4031 occurs when the SSO mapping is lost during migration. To fix it:

Add the ubp_billing_role attribute to the SAML configuration in your Identity Provider (IdP).
Set it to billing_viewer, billing_editor, or billing_admin.
Go to UBP Admin → SSO → Re-provision and re-provision the affected user.
Ask the user to log out and log back in so the new SSO attribute is applied.

**chunk_id cited**: `BM-005::t2`

### Cited Answer 3

**Question**: How long do migration credits last and what happens when they expire?

**Answer**:
Migration credits expire 12 months from the migration date. Credits that are unused at expiry are forfeited and do not convert to cash refunds. This policy is non-negotiable and cannot be extended by Support. Escalations on this topic should be directed to the customer's Account Executive.

## 5. Refusal Transcripts (3 out-of-corpus questions)

### Refusal 1

**Question**: What is the refund SLA for billing migration disputes?

**Response**:
{
  "answer": "Based on **6** relevant support ticket(s) in your index:\n\n**[1] Invoice and Credit Migration — How Your Balance Transfers** (`BM-003`)\n> Article BM-003 — Invoice and Credit Migration — How Your Balance Transfers  reference rate published on the migration date.

Ask them to navigate to **Billing → Invoice → View MIGRATION_CREDIT detail**. 2. The detail view shows the LBE balance, exchange rate, and conversion date. 3. If the LBE balance shown is wrong, open a case with Billing Engineering (not Tier-1 Support). 4. If the exchange rate is wrong (more than 0.5% from the published ECB rate), open a case with Billing Operations.  Do NOT issue a manual credit to compensate — manual credits on top of a disputed `MIGRATION_CREDIT` create double-credit entries that require a full ledger reconciliation.\n\n**[3] Billing Migration Error Codes — Reference Guide** (`BM-002`)\n> Article BM-002 — Billing Migration Error Codes — Reference Guide  endpoint | Customer checks endpoint availability; Support can trigger a manual replay via Admin → Webhooks → Replay |  ## How to Look Up an Error Code  1.

The addendum confirms:  - The customer's plan terms are preserved in the UBP. - Any volume commitments carry over. - The migration date and any grace period agreed with the Account Executive.  Addendums that are not signed 7 days before the migration date trigger an automatic extension of the Phase 3 date by 14 days.

## 6. Chunker Choice — Which Ships and Why

Both paragraph and table-aware chunking achieved a perfect 8/8 Hit-in-Top-5 score, so neither strategy had a higher retrieval hit rate. The retrieval case that stood out was Q4, where table-aware chunking had a lower similarity score (0.3504) than paragraph chunking (0.3614), even though both still retrieved the correct BM-002 article at Top-1. This shows that table-aware chunking did not improve every individual retrieval case, but it preserved structured table information effectively while maintaining perfect retrieval coverage. I would keep the table-aware strategy in production because it achieved the same 8/8 Hit-in-Top-5 accuracy and performed better on several queries, particularly Q1, Q2, Q5, and Q8, making it a better fit for support content containing tables and structured error-code information.

## 7. Bonus — Precision vs Completeness Tension

| Metric | Table-aware | Paragraph |
|---|---|---|
| **Top chunk** | `BM-003::t2` | `BM-003::p1` |
| **Top score** | **0.7044** | **0.6857** |
| **Retrieval winner** | ✅ Table-aware | — |
| **Context** | Focuses strongly on the invoice-status table | Includes broader migration-credit context |
| **Final answer** | Includes invoice statuses **and** some credit information | Includes invoice statuses **and** credit expiry information |
